# 🧠 Neural Network Hyperparameter Visualizer

An interactive web app built with **Streamlit** and **Keras** to help visualize how neural network hyperparameters affect model training and decision boundaries on synthetic datasets.

---

## 🎯 Aim

To demonstrate the effect of different hyperparameters such as learning rate, activation function, batch size, and train-test split on neural network performance using synthetic classification datasets (`moons`, `circles`, `blobs`).
